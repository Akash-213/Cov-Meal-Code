A REACT Project to connect home quarantined COVID19 affected with Tiffin Providers


## Inspiration :
As we all know most of the COVID-19 people are now preferring home quarantine. 
But it's very difficult for them to manage their meals during this quarantine and to provide a 
helping hand in this situation we have come up with this idea to somehow contribute to the community.

## What it does :

• In this portal, you will be able to search for food service providers in your nearby locality who would home deliver the meals. 
<br/>• This will help you focus more on your health rather than the preparation of your meals. Our motive is to help people to rest during their quarantine periods.
<br/>
• If you are a food service provider who is serving these Covid warriors, you can register yourself on the portal.


## How we built it :
• We mutually decided to work using Reactjs as we had recently completed a course on React, understanding how actually does it work. For the data storage part, we used Firebase to store food service provider’s information, which includes their contact numbers, details of dishes, location, and many other related things.

• We together had meetings, we collaborated on the work and implemented it. Going on step by step process of how we built it -

• First we researched, we identified the problem, we decided to implement it Then we found the requirements, we required details of those food service providers, and details of organizations that help such people We then decided on the Tech Stack to be used and started using React with Firebase. Once we completed the basic part of the portal, we added better designs to the components and even kept some future plans to improve the functionalities

## Challenges we ran into :

• First major challenge we faced was to decide what all functionalities are to be included in the first version. <br/>
• Next we didn’t have a lot of knowledge of Firebase, but we knew that Firebase would make it easy to work on. So, we learnt the basics of how do we work with it. Next up, we had to gather the details of food providers in a short span of time, finally, we registered around 30 providers on our portal


## Accomplishments that we're proud of :
We have successfully registered around 30 food providers on the portal and we got few reviews from our friends and other food providers that we are really helping the community in some way. This felt like a great achievement to the team


## What we learned :
We learned how to manage a project, how to communicate on the planning for it, how to talk with people for asking their service details, how to manage time and how do we complete some task within a deadline. Overall the major part was the learning experience, we worked with React as well as Firebase, which improved our Dev skills. 



## What's next for CovMeal :
Our future planning includes adding an Instagram direct message functionality so that people can message those ‘helpful organization’ which you will be able to see on our portal. Next we were thinking to add more details for help which would include some availability of meds to the people, any kind of help, like a need for a maid during these times, or someone that can donate, etc. There are many more ideas and innovative things that could be implemented, this would just require time, we could make it more scalable and one that has many more functionalities
